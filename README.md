# üß† Paradox Mass Engine (PME)

## ‚ú® What is PME?
The **Paradox Mass Engine** (PME) quantifies the destabilizing effect of paradoxes within a coherence field ‚Äî cognitive, narrative, symbolic, or systemic.

It introduces a formal equation to measure *Paradox Mass* (PM) using three factors:

\[
PM = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\kappa_i \cdot R_i \cdot C_i)
\]

Where:  
- **Œ∫·µ¢** = Inherent complexity of the paradox  
- **R·µ¢** = Recursion depth it triggers  
- **C·µ¢** = Coherence destabilization factor  



In Plain English:
> ‚ÄúParadox mass is calculated by summing the combined weight of each paradox‚Äôs complexity, how deep it triggers recursion, and how much it destabilizes the coherence field.‚Äù
Why It Matters
PME provides a **mathematical foundation** for:
- Analyzing complex thought patterns
- Designing paradox-based AI cognition models
- Simulating narrative destabilization
- Stress-testing philosophical or symbolic systems
- Measuring narrative recursion in real-world systems (media, religion, AI ethics, etc.)

PME is Just the Beginning
This repository serves as the open core kernel for a broader system of paradox
quantification and coherence modeling.
Coming Soon (PME v2 & PCI Integration)
- Real-time paradox mapping tools
- AI coherence destabilization detection
- Integration into PCI (Perceptual Coherence Intelligence)
- Recursive narrative prediction engines
Not all destabilization is destructive. Some paradoxes are doorways
