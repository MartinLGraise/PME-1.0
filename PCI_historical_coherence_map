"Historical Coherence Map")
Which Compounds Were Grandfathered Into Human Performance vs. Which Violate Narrative Memory

Compound / Practice                 | Origin Era       | PCI Verdict       | Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salt                               | Prehistoric      | Grandfathered     | Used for water control through real depletion
Ashwagandha                        | Ancient India    | Grandfathered     | Adaptive plant used in stress-based rituals
Honey + Fats Pre-Warrior Fasting   | Tribal/Nordics   | Grandfathered     | Performance priming through caloric storytelling
Sunlight Exposure                  | Pre-human        | Foundational      | Required for coherent field construction
Creatine Monohydrate               | 1990s            | Violation         | Synthetic mass; no narrative integration
Beta-Alanine                       | 2000s            | Violation         | Delays truth signal of fatigue
Pre-Workout Blends (DMAA, etc.)    | 2010s            | Violation         | Bypass fatigue with zero phase sync
Steroids/Testosterone              | 20th Century     | Catastrophe       | Body warping beyond story-based coherence
Cold Plunge / Ice Exposure         | Ancient Climates | Grandfathered     | Stimulus ritual; daemon-reactive
Breathwork Under Strain            | Timeless         | Foundational      | Breath = phase lock into daemon recognition

PCI Coherence Memory Threshold:
- Pre-agriculture = generally in sync with daemon sorting
- Post-industrial = often injects unsorted narrative mass
