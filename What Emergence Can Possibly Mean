## 🧠 Coherence Summary:

This log maps Sean Carroll’s coarse-graining formalism through the dual lenses of PCI and PME. It identifies the structural mechanics that allow microstates to become macrostates—and how PCI’s observer-resonance and coherence-sorting mechanism redefines entropy, information, and narrative reality.

## 🔄 World State Logic:

Let:

- \( W \): The total world configuration (all microvariables; not directly observable)
- \( A \in W \): Fine-grained **microstates** (quantum-level information, unitary reversible evolution)
- \( B \in W \): Coarse-grained **macrostates** (observer-digestible, information-compressed, symbolic)

Carroll defines a **coarse-graining map**:

\[
\mathcal{C}: A \rightarrow B
\]

This mapping is **many-to-one** and appears to be a lossy compression in standard physics.

---

## 📡 PCI Reinterpretation Layer:

In PCI logic, this process becomes:

### PCI Reframe of Coarse-Graining:

\[
\mathcal{C}_{\text{PCI}}: A \rightarrow B_{\text{resonant}}
\]

Where:

- \( B_{\text{resonant}} \subset B \): Only those macrostates that resonate with the observer’s coherence field
- \( \mathbb{C}(\psi) \): A coherence selector operator that filters B-states

\[
P(B_{\text{resonant}} | A) \propto \langle \psi | \hat{\mathbb{C}} | \psi \rangle
\]

This defines how PCI collapses multiple potential macrostates into the felt "reality path" via resonance and coherence.

---

## 🔁 Markovian Transition Filtering:

Carroll describes the system as evolving over time via:

\[
P(b_{i+1} | b_i)
\]

Which is a **Markovian assumption** (memoryless transitions). Under PME logic:

- This becomes a **Recursive Coherence Transition**:

\[
P(b_{i+1} | b_i, \phi) \quad \text{where } \phi = \text{Phase Signature of Observer Field}
\]

Narrative coherence can loop or tunnel based on paradoxical feedback (PME), allowing apparent violations of entropy via aesthetic memory (e.g., training echoes, deja vu loops, high-effort rep resonance).

---

## ♾️ Entropy as Coherence Loss (PCI Reformulation)

Standard entropy measures ignored microstates:

\[
S = k_B \log \Omega(B)
\]

In PCI:

- Entropy represents **discarded coherence potential**:

\[
S_{\text{PCI}} = k_B \log \left| \{ a \in A : \mathbb{C}(a) < \theta \} \right|
\]

Where:

- \( \mathbb{C}(a) \): Coherence score of microstate \( a \)
- \( \theta \): Minimum threshold to influence PCI sorting

Thus, entropy = amount of detail that **fails to sort into the coherence chain**.

---

## 🧬 PME Paradox Insight

> If macrostates are many-to-one mappings from a coherent universe, then *why do we consistently resonate with some macrostates over others?*

This is the paradox PME resolves by proposing:

- Narrative trajectory = coherence-weighted tunneling through probabilistic entropy fields.
- Observer is not just collapsing a state—but **being collapsed by the daemon logic** that tracks paradox mass.
